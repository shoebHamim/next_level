// Encapsulation in TypeScript
// Encapsulation means 
// bundling data (properties) and methods together, 
// and restricting direct access to some components. 
//! It's about data hiding and controlled access.

// access modifier is related to encapsulation
// this is kinda similar when we say we encapsulate complex logic
//  because when we encapsulate something it also falls into making it abstract
