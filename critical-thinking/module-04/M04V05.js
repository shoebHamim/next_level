//Problem Statement

//A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence of characters that reads the same backward as it does forward.

//Your task is to write a JavaScript function, isPalindrome(str), that takes a string str
//and returns true if the string is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

//The function must work for complex phrases, not just single words. To do this, your function must:
//   Be case-insensitive (i.e., 'R' is treated the same as 'r').
//   Ignore all non-alphanumeric characters (i.e., spaces, punctuation like commas, colons, periods, etc.).

//? Input and Output
// "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" -> true
// "Level" -> true
// "car" -> false
